This is app is built with Angular, version 5, Angular Material Design and Firebase.

## A File Is Missing!
For obvious security reasons one file is not included in this repo: 

__src/environments/firebase.json__

A mock of the file is included in: 

__src/environments/firebase-mock.json__

The data for this file comes directly from Firebase's "Add Firebase to your web app" modal. Simply copy the value of the ```config``` object and wrap the keys in double quotes to make them JSON compliant. 
Then save the file as "firebase.json".

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.3.
